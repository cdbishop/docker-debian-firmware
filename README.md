This container derives from
[vcatechnology/debian-firmware](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/debian-firmware) so that the
image has the latest [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for building VCA firmware packages

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/debian-firmware](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/debian-firmware/)
